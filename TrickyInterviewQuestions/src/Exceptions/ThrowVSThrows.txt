Difference between Throws, Throw and Throwable

throws clause is used to declare an exception and throw keyword is used to throw an exception explicitly.
If we see syntax wise then throw is followed by an instance variable and throws is followed by exception class names.
The keyword throw is used inside method body to invoke an exception and throws clause is used in method declaration (signature).

throw

throw new Exception("You have some exception")
throw new IOException("Connection failed!!")

throws

public int myMethod() throws IOException, ArithmeticException, NullPointerException {}

throwable

Super class that contents all exceptions.

Error vs Exception

You can recover from an Exception i.e. SQLException, IOException, NullPointerException
You cannot recover from an Error. They are usually caused by the environment. i.e. StackOverFlow, OutOfMemoryError
