Polymorphism
The capability of a method to act different based on the object that it is acting upon.
There are two types of polymorphism.
	
    Static Polymorphism – Compile polymorphism (Overloading)
    	It is solved during compiler time.
	Example: the use of different constructors based on the number of attributes they receive.

    Dynamic Polymorphism – Runtime polymorphism (Overriding)
        It is solver during run time.
        Example: Using a method that it implemented on a super class and a sub class.
